    <p>President Rumen Radev opened here on Wednesday a roundtable on the criteria and public expectations for the
        upcoming election of the next prosecutor general. Invited to participate are representatives of NGOs working in
        the field of the judicial system and professional organizations of legal experts, Radev's Press Secretariat
        reported.</p>
    <p>There are huge public expectations from the next prosecutor general, who will have to face difficult tasks. That
        is why it is very important that they have high public approval, which also means having a transparent, clear
        procedure and election criteria, in full compliance with the law, Radev said at the opening. </p>
